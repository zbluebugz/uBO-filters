# uBO-filters: Customized Filters for uBlock Origin

Welcome to the repository for my personalized "My filters" rules designed specifically for uBlock Origin. These filters are primarily crafted to assist other users in enhancing their browsing experience.

## Instagram.txt

### Customized Rules:

1. **Existing Filter Lists**: Some "Filter lists" rules have been made "inactive" to eliminate potential disruptions experienced while using Instagram.

2. **Customised Rules added**: New rules have been introduced to conceal Sponsored and Suggested articles, reducing their visibility without collapsing them.

### Notes:
- **Maintaining Article Structure**: It's important to avoid collapsing articles as this will trigger complaints from Instagram's interface.
- **Intermittent Testing**: Although I don't use uBlock Origin extensively with Instagram, periodic testing of the rules remains on my agenda.
- **Complementary Solutions**: My personal approach to addressing Instagram's idiosyncrasies primarily involves a tailored userscript. However, this script is currently not available for public use.

## Pinterest.txt

### Customized Rules:

1. **Existing Filter Lists**: Some "Filter lists" rules have been made "inactive" due to various issues with them.

2. **New Custom Filter Rule"**: Added a customised filter rule to detect "Promoted by" articles.

### Notes:
- Not all "Promoted by" articles are collapsed - some are and some are not. If you see bit white spaces, that's where a "Promoted by" article is. Nothing much can be done about this as Pinterest uses _absolute positioning_ of articles.
- A rare "Ad â€¢ Paid partnership" article has been seen, but I did not have a filter ready for it. It is in the pinterest.txt file if you wish to test it.
