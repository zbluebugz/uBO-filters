# uBO-filters: Customized Filters for uBlock Origin

Welcome to the repository for my personalized "My filters" rules designed specifically for uBlock Origin. These filters are primarily crafted to assist other users in enhancing their browsing experience.

### Customized Rules:

1. **Refining Filter Lists**: Some "Filter lists" rules have been fine-tuned to eliminate potential disruptions experienced while using Instagram.

2. **Tailored Visibility for Sponsored and Suggested Articles**: New rules have been introduced to intelligently conceal sponsored and suggested articles, reducing their visibility without collapsing them.

### Notes:

- **Maintaining Article Structure**: It's important to avoid collapsing articles as this will trigger complaints from Instagram's interface.

- **Community-Centric Creation**: These rules have been curated with the intention of supporting fellow users, a contribution I engage in through [reddit/r/uBlockOrigin](https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin).

- **Intermittent Testing**: Although I don't use uBlock Origin extensively with Instagram, periodic testing of the rules remains on my agenda.

- **Complementary Solutions**: My personal approach to addressing Instagram's idiosyncrasies primarily involves a tailored userscript. However, this script is currently not available for public use.

### Customized Rules:

1. **Refining Filter Lists**: Some "Filter lists" rules have been fine-tuned to eliminate potential disruptions experienced while using Pinterest.

2. **Tailored Visibility for Promoted by Articles**: New rules have been introduced to intelligently conceal "Promoted by" articles, reducing their visibility without collapsing them.

### Notes:
A rare "Ad â€¢ Paid partnership" article has been seen, but did not have a filter ready for it. It is in the pinterest.txt file if you wish to test it.
