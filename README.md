# uBO-filters
My customised "My filters" rules that I use in uBO (mainly for helping out other people)

# Instagram.txt
Customised rules:
1) Knock out some "Filter lists" rules (due to causing hiccups in Instagram).
2) Added rules to hide, but not collapse sponsored and suggested articles.

Notes:
- If articles are collapsed, Instagram will complain!
- These rules were created to help out other people (via [reddit/r/uBlockOrigin](https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin)
- Instead, I use userscript to deal with various Instagram's quirks (currently not available for public use)
